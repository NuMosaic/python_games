# python_games
This is a collection of small python games, including: text-based adventure games, tic-tac-toe, 
hangman, and more!

For now, the main groups of games will be *text-based* and *GUI*. Each will have its own folder so that things stay organized.

### Test-Based:
These games will be the kind that prints instructions and ASCII art to the console rather than updating a GUI. They will fall into these categories:
- Adventure games
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Hangman
- Game of Life (more of a simulation than a game)
- Guessing Game


### GUI
These games will implement a GUI (graphical user interface) and have a window generating images rather than printing to the console. This includes:
- Card Games
- Langauge Learning Games
- Maze Games
- GUI versions of the Text-Based games
- etc. (when I think of more)
